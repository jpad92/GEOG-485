	<ul>
	<li>I want to address the question on if there is a correlation between the median household incomes of east side (east of Interstate 25) the Albuquerque area and the locations of the well-known, chained natural grocers. I am going to assume that the locations of these higher income areas. It will not be a coincidence, organic food is expensive and it seems that these companies are only interested in feeding organic food to the upper class, instead of the general population. 
	<li>The target audience is the general population to raise awareness on providing healthy food to general population, not just the people who can afford it. 
	<li>The geographic region that my problem area represents is the east side of the Albuquerque area.
	<li>****Need to inquire about bounding box!!!!*****
	<li>I want to include the income levels by census tracts of the Albuquerque area, and also point features of the locations of the organic food stores.
	<li>I am going to use EPSG: 4326. I will be obtaining the locations of the stores from Google Maps, and they present them in lat/long.
	<li>I am acquiring data from Google Maps and UNM RGIS. I will obtain the locations of the stores from Google and get the income data from RGIS.
	<li>I will have to get the census tract data from UNM RGIS, then have to filter out the mass amount of data on the shape file.
