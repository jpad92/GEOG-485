	<ul>
	<li>I want to address the question on if there is a correlation between the median household incomes of east side (east of Interstate 25) the Albuquerque area and the locations of the well-known, chained natural grocers. I am going to assume that the locations of these higher income areas. It will not be a coincidence, organic food is expensive and it seems that these companies are only interested in feeding organic food to the upper class, instead of the general population. 
	<li>The target audience is the general population to raise awareness on providing healthy food to general population, not just the people who can afford it. 
	<li>The geographic region that my problem area represents is the east side of the Albuquerque area. It is a local region and the bounding box in lat/long is: [35.383251 -106.810485, 35.383251 -106. 181517, 34.988177 -106.810485, 34.988177 -106. 181517]
	<li>I want to include the income levels by census tracts of the Albuquerque area, and also point features of the locations of the organic food stores. The income levels are vector data and the locations will be point features.
	<li>I am going to use EPSG: 900913. That is what the open layers projection is, and therefore I will have to transform the kml porjection and the locations of the organic stores from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:900913
	<li>I am acquiring data from Google Maps and UNM RGIS. I will obtain the locations of the stores from Google and get the income data from RGIS.
	<li>I will have to get the census tract data from UNM RGIS, then have to filter out the mass amount of data on the shape file.
