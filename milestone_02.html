	<h1>Lab Assignment 1/ Milestone 2</h1>
	<h2>Question 1</h2>
	<p>The white space shown in the source code page correlates to the white space seen on the web browser page. Also, when the commands are on seperate lines, it translates to entire space between the breaks in paragraphs. </p>
	<h2>Question 2</h2>
	<p>The font size is different between the h1 and h2. The two headings are still in bold, but h2 is the subheading, and therefore a smaller font. </p>
	<h2>Question 3</h2>
	<p> To create additional list elements in either the "topic" or "data type" lists, we would use the 'li' command. </p>
